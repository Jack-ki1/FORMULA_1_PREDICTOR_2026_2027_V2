# F1 Predictor 2026 — Race Intelligence Platform

> **Live on Hugging Face Spaces** — Docker SDK, port `7860`, ephemeral storage safe (uses `/data` bucket if mounted).

A comprehensive Formula 1 race prediction system for the 2026 season, featuring ML-based predictions, live data integration, and interactive dashboards.

## Features

- **ML-Powered Predictions**: Gradient boosting models with ensemble methods for race winner, podium, points, and qualifying predictions
- **Live Data Integration**: Real-time data from Jolpica, OpenF1, and FastF1 APIs
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Flask-based web interface with multiple views (Dashboard, Standings, H2H, Constructors, Analytics, Reports)
- **Tunable Model Parameters**: Adjustable chaos level, wet-weather influence, reliability factors, and strategy aggressiveness
- **Grid Position Modeling**: Real qualifying results with manual override capabilities
- **Fantasy Scoring**: Real F1 Fantasy rules implementation
- **Championship Tracking**: Driver and constructor standings with historical progression
- **Export Reports**: CSV, JSON, PDF, and shareable summary cards

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```

## Configuration

Key configuration files:

- `.env` - Environment variables and API settings
- `config/settings.py` - Application settings
- `config/feature_weights.py` - Model parameter defaults
- `config/constants.py` - Team colors, points system, target definitions

## Model Architecture

The prediction system uses an ensemble of ML models:

- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)**: Primary tabular predictor
- **Random Forest**: Secondary model for diversity
- **Logistic Regression**: Interpretable baseline
- **Elo Rating System**: Driver skill tracking
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Race outcome simulation
- **Grid Model**: Qualifying-to-race conversion with empirical pole-to-win weighting

## Data Sources

- **Jolpica**: Historical standings, race results, qualifying data
- **OpenF1**: Live session timing and telemetry
- **FastF1**: Lap-by-lap telemetry and practice/qualifying data
- **Hugging Face**: Historical race data archive (tracinginsights/RaceData)

## Dashboard Views

- **Dashboard**: Main prediction interface with session-specific forecasts
- **Standings**: Live driver and constructor championship standings
- **H2H Comparison**: Head-to-head driver comparisons
- **Constructors**: Team performance analysis
- **Analytics & Settings**: Model accuracy metrics and parameter tuning
- **Reports**: Export predictions in various formats

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest tests/
```

### Code Style

```bash
black .
flake8 .
```

### Database Migrations

```bash
python scripts/migrate_db.py
```

## Hugging Face Spaces Deployment (Docker SDK)

This repo is **HF Spaces-ready** (`sdk: docker`, `app_port: 7860`). The included `Dockerfile` uses `python:3.11-slim`, non-root `user` (1000), `gunicorn` on `0.0.0.0:7860`, and `wsgi:app`.

1. **Create Space** on https://huggingface.co/new-space → choose **Docker** SDK, public/private.
2. **Push**:
   ```bash
   git remote add space https://huggingface.co/spaces/<you>/<space-name>
   git push space main
   ```
   HF will build `Dockerfile` and expose `https://<you>-<space>.hf.space`.

3. **Secrets** (Settings → Secrets): `HF_TOKEN` (for private datasets), `SECRET_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc. — never commit `.env`.
4. **Persistent storage**: ephemeral by default. Attach a **Bucket** at `/data` (Space Settings → Storage) — the app auto-migrates `sqlite:///./f1_predictions.db` → `sqlite:////data/f1_predictions.db` and caches to `/data/*` when `/data` is mounted. Without a bucket, data survives until the Space sleeps.
5. **Local Docker test**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t f1-predictor-2026 .
   docker run -p 7860:7860 -e PORT=7860 f1-predictor-2026
   # → http://localhost:7860/health
   ```

## Docker Deployment (local)

```bash
docker build -t f1-predictor-2026 .
docker run -p 7860:7860 f1-predictor-2026
# legacy local port 5000 still works via FLASK_PORT env, but HF expects 7860
```

## Architecture Audit Summary

The current F1 prediction platform follows a layered architecture with three primary data sources (Jolpica, OpenF1, FastF1), a session context processing layer, and a prediction engine using both ML models and Monte Carlo simulations.

A full, verified audit of this codebase — including what's actually wired
into the running app versus what exists as unused code — lives in
[`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md). The summary below was previously inaccurate about
several items' real status; it's corrected here.

### Key Technical Debt Items (verified status)

- **Missing API Integration Tests**: `test_api_integration.py` still does not exist. Not addressed.
- **Probability Validation Gaps**: `engine/probability_model.py::enforce_probability_sum` normalises winner probabilities to sum to 1.0 — addressed, and covered by `tests/test_predictor.py`.
- **Hardcoded Configuration**: Monte Carlo simulation count is configurable via the `simulation_count` parameter on `generate_prediction()` (see `engine/predictor.py`) — addressed.
- **Logging Deficiencies**: Most library code (`engine/`, `data/`, `database/`) uses `logging`; the Flask blueprint route handlers and CLI scripts still use `print()` — partially addressed, tracked as a nit in `AUDIT.md`.
- **Data Pipeline Limitations**: `data/pipeline.py` / `pipeline_utils.py` / `pipeline_config.py` provide a shared normalization layer — addressed.
- **Database Configuration**: Configurable via `DATABASE_URL` in `config/settings.py` — addressed, though see `AUDIT.md` M-3 for a caveat (two separate connection-pooling implementations exist).
- **AI Provider Integration**: `engine/ai_client.py` / `ai/provider.py` integrate Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq, Mistral, Cohere, HuggingFace, and local Ollama — addressed.
- **Dashboard Enhancements**: Multi-view Flask dashboard exists — addressed.
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 12 tests exist and pass, but large parts of the codebase (most of `engine/`, all of `security/`, `data/api_client.py`, `reports/`) remain untested — partially addressed. See `AUDIT.md` T-1.
- **Security Enhancements**: `security/auth.py` and `security/middleware.py` implement real JWT auth, security headers, and input validation — **but neither module is imported by any route the running app actually registers** (`dashboard/app.py`). The only blueprints that used them (`dashboard.py`, `health.py`) are not wired into the app, and there is no login endpoint anywhere to issue a token even if they were. **Not actually addressed in the running application** — see `AUDIT.md` B-6.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: `monitoring/blueprint.py` implements a real Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint, but it is never registered by `dashboard/app.py` or `main.py`. **Not actually addressed in the running application** — see `AUDIT.md` m-3.
- **Performance Optimization**: Response caching (`cache/redis.py`) and DB connection pooling exist — addressed.
- **API Integration Tests**: Same as above — still just the 3 existing test files, no dedicated API integration suite.
- **Final Documentation and Handoff**: This section itself was the main inaccuracy found; corrected as part of the repo audit (see `AUDIT.md`).

> **Note on the sections below:** these "Phase N Implementation Summary"
> write-ups predate this audit and describe intended/aspirational state
> rather than verified fact — e.g. Phase 13 below claims "Full Coverage:
> All Jolpica, OpenF1, and FastF1 endpoints tested," but `tests/` contains
> only `test_ai_client.py`, `test_dashboard_blueprints.py`, and
> `test_predictor.py` — none of which test `jolpica_client.py`,
> `openf1_client.py`, or `fastf1_integration.py` at all. Similarly, Phase
> 11's monitoring claim is real code (`monitoring/blueprint.py`) that is
> never registered by the running app (see `AUDIT.md` m-3). Treat the
> sections below as a roadmap/wishlist, not a changelog, until each claim
> has been re-verified.
